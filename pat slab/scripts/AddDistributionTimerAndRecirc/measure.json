  "modeler_description": "This measure creates new OS:OtherEquipment and OS:WaterUseDefinition and OS:WaterUseEquipment objects for showers, sinks and baths in accordance with the 2014 BA Simulation Protocols document. Major modeling assumptions (schedule profiles, etc. follow methods used by BeOpt v2.2, using functional relationships described in the \"Monthly Profiles\" tab of the B10 Analysis New Construction 2011.1.26.xlsx spreadsheet. Daily internal gain, and water usage amounts are modified based on user arguments.",
  "description": "This measure allows the user to model Building America Benchmark service water draws and service water distribution systems, as well as user defined service water draws and service water distribution descriptions. Service water draws and distribution systems impact both the volume of hot water required to meet the delivered hot water loads at the fixtures and the internal heat gains to the building. Relationships for distribution losses and gains related to internal gain and gallons per day per fixture are described in the \"Monthly Profiles\" tab of the B10 Analysis New Construction 2011.1.26.xlsx Spreadsheet.",
